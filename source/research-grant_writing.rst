.. _sec.grant_writing.template:

No grant application is the same and therefore no single description can be best fit each proposal. Below is a general template two liner description, however, the HPC Team would prefer all faculty contact the HPC team at deac-help@wfu.edu before submitting a grant that will utilize the DEAC Cluster. 

Template Description 
====================

.. admonition:: Template Description

     The WFU DEAC Cluster Facility is a centrally managed, University supported,
     high performance computing environment containing over 5,000 processors,
     40TB of memory, 36 GPUs, and 287TB of disk storage jointly funded by faculty
     research grant awards and the University. The cluster supports faculty from
     16 departments, including: Biomed, Business, Chemistry, Computer Science,
     Engineering, and Physics. All grant contributions are applied as a service
     fee to gain additional priority and/or storage above free-tier baseline utilization.
     All acquired service fees are applied to offset the annual cost Information
     Systems incurs to operate and maintain the DEAC Cluster Facility. 

The HPC Team needs to fully understand software, storage, compute, and timeline for the grant to provide the best write-up possible and accurately estimate needs. At the end of your grant, please work with the HPC Team to determine which data should be archived and kept according to grant requirements, which data is desired to be kept on research storage (if any), and what data can be deleted.

.. important::
  Users must :ref:`acknowledge the DEAC Cluster<sec.acknowledging>` for all findings, publications, manuscripts, posters, and/or oral presentations that result directly or indirectly from the use of its resources.

Acknowledgements help show the importance of the DEAC Cluster Facility to researchers at Wake Forest University. This includes the resources provided and services rendered by the HPC Team.

Once your manuscript has been published, please send the HPC Team (via deac-help@wfu.edu) the DOI or link.

.. admonition:: Resource Statement

    Below is a template Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources statement that can be used by faculty to be included in various grant applications.

Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources 
==========================================

------------------------
Facilities and Equipment 
------------------------
WFU will provide all infrastructure components needed to support computational research on a High Performance Computing (HPC) Solution, including the data center facility, power, uninterruptible power supply (UPS), computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units and chillers, fire suppression, network connectivity, and internet routing. WFU will also provide hardware and software support through the Information Systems (IS) Department and the HPC Team. 

---------------
Other Resources 
---------------
IS utilizes two data centers and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host instructional, and research computational services for WFU faculty and students. 

AWS is utilized primarily for Enterprise services support, but a small number of virtual desktop environments have been created in support of classroom instruction. This includes t2.micro systems (1 vCPU and 1GB of memory) for the majority of instances, and g4dn.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, and 125GB NVMe) used for students in a Computer Science Neural Networks & Deep Learning class. Both of these virtual desktop system types are configured by IS Infrastructure Admins as needed each semester. 

The main WFU Data Center is located in Alumni Hall, and hosts the bulk of WFU’s current HPC Solution, the DEAC Cluster. The DEAC Cluster (https://hpc.wfu.edu) is a traditional HPC Cluster design to support CPU-intensive workloads, with baseline usage available for all faculty and students to use at no cost. The DEAC Cluster is centrally funded by the IS Department, with user contributions providing resources enhancements as needed by faculty who are seeking above baseline utilization or have non-standard resource requirements. A small portion of DEAC Cluster resources are hosted in the A1A Data Center, located off campus, to provide redundancy in the event of a major outage.

Total resources available on the DEAC Cluster include 106 dedicated nodes, containing 5312 CPU Cores, 41TB of memory, 287 TB storage, and 192,512 CUDA Cores. The facility is a heterogeneous collection of Compute nodes with AMD EPYC based Milan and Genoa 64-bit CPUs connected via 25GB Ethernet, as well as older Compute Nodes with Intel Xeon based Cascade Lake 64-bit CPUs contained within a 10G connected Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS). 7 GPU nodes contain all CUDA cores from a mix of 36 GPUs Cards, including V100s, A100s (40GB & 80GB), and L40Ss. The cluster storage environment consists primarily of a NetApp AFF A300 storage array, hosting over 287 TB of shared storage via NFS; and an unlimited AWS cloud-based archive. Each storage path is available via 10-gigabit Ethernet from redundant connections; volume configuration follows best practices to provide the utmost reliability, availability, and security to users. Additionally, every node contains at least 2TB of local, temporary scratch space to assist with higher IO throughput.

All DEAC Cluster resources are managed and maintained by the WFU HPC Team, with facility, network, and data center teams providing additional support as needed. Faculty and student users of DEAC Cluster resources are supported by the HPC Team. All DEAC Cluster compute resources are accessible via https through a web portal and/or SSH to three user-facing login nodes, where users submit jobs to run via the SLURM Workload Manager. Research storage is designed with department based root directories, and correlating research groups paths underneath. The HPC Team controls access to research group members and path permissions, making modifications to membership only after receiving research group advisor written permission via email. Users conduct all research from their research group paths, with all correlating research related source data, scripts, and output stored within.

.. Computational equipment
.. ```````````````````````

..     The DEAC Linux Cluster has 95 computational blades containing over 3,820
..     processing cores dedicated to research and teaching use. The facility is a
..     heterogeneous collection of Haswell, Broadwell and Skylake 64-bit Intel Xeon
..     based computational nodes, presenting over 19TB of RAM and 170TB of disk
..     storage. All of these blades are contained within a Cisco Unified Computing
..     System (UCS), sharing a redundant 10G Ethernet fabric; and all of the blades
..     utilize a usNIC kernel bypass to reduce latency by 67% to improve research
..     that is highly parallel in nature. The cluster storage environment consists
..     primarily of a NetApp FAS8040 storage array, hosting over 170TB of shared
..     storage via NFS; and an unlimited space, cloud-based archive via NFS from
..     AWS. Each storage path presents it's storage via 10-gigabit ethernet
..     connectivity from redundant connections; volume configuration follows best
..     practices to provide the utmost reliability, availability, and security to
..     users. This arrangement provides an efficient presentation to our compute
..     nodes, within minimal resource consumption and administrative overhead. The
..     cluster also utilizes a virtualization environment with failover redundancy
..     to provide three head nodes as well as several maintenance node virtual
..     machines for fault tolerant, efficient cluster operation.

..     The cluster is directly connected to the Wake Forest University campus core
..     network router through fiber-based, 10-gigabit Ethernet. Access to the
..     cluster by users is possible through any one of three head-nodes. The WFU
..     DEAC cluster is co-located at the A1A facility within the Innovation Quarter
..     (or Wake Downtown) that includes all research computing equipment for the
..     University's Reynolda Campus and School of Medicine. This facility is
..     approximately 5000 sq-ft with sufficient cooling and power capacity to
..     sustain all current equipment (including the WFU DEAC cluster) as well as
..     projected growth.

..     Internally, the cluster is capable of significant growth. By design, the
..     cluster scales on all fronts through the simple addition of hardware:
..     computational power scales by adding compute nodes, interactive logins
..     scales by adding head nodes, cluster maintenance requirements scale by
..     adding maintenance nodes, disk bandwidth scales by adding connectivity to
..     the storage arrays, disk capacity scales by adding disk trays to the storage
..     arrays.

..     The current networking infrastructure hardware, based on Cisco's 6500 series
..     switches, can support this scalability to over 1000 nodes with
..     gigabit-Ethernet to all nodes. Naturally scaling the "access" layer of this
..     network, via additional Cisco Catalyst 6500 or Nexus 5000 switch pairs,
..     would add support for additional nodes.

..     Wake Forest University and the College of Arts of Sciences provide
..     administrative support for the DEAC cluster at little cost to the
..     researchers.

..     All of the aforementioned cluster hardware is fully supported by the Wake
..     Forest University Information Services Department and two full-time
..     dedicated Linux system administrators. All capital expenses and grant
..     contributions will be utilized for contributing computational hardware to
..     this pre-existing infrastructure. Through any Wake Forest University grant
..     contribution, the Office of Research and Sponsor Programs will match it
..     one-to-one (up to $75K). The computational hardware will be purchased
..     through the Procurement Uniform Guidance and be open-bid to resellers.

.. WFUSM CTSA
.. ----------

.. One page document written for the WFUSM CTSA proposal effort, due by Fall 2007.
.. This document highlights the centralized support and scalability of the cluster.
.. These abilities are crucial for the HPC environment being the solid backbone of
.. any large scale effort.

.. This has **not** been updated since the Fall 2007 submission.

..     The WFU DEAC HPC cluster is a research computing environment that is
..     centrally maintained by the University. The cluster administrator team
..     currently consists of Timothy Miller and Yonas Abraham, both of whom have
..     obtained doctoral degrees in Physics using HPC clusters. This computational
..     experience affords an understanding of user operational needs and allows for
..     a better and more effective match of cluster design to the problems being
..     studied.

..     WFU DEAC provides unique capabilities to campus researchers that are not
..     available from general campus computing: high speed networking
..     infrastructure, large scale storage and computational capacity.
..     Architecturally, WFU DEAC is a Linux-based Beowulf style cluster consisting
..     of 360 processors with 1 GB RAM per processor. These processors are
..     distributed among 153 nodes, each with gigabit Ethernet connectivity. A
..     subset of these nodes uses specialized, high speed, low latency
..     interconnects: 24 nodes (96 processors) use Infiniband based standard, 16
..     nodes (32 processors) use the Myrinet based technology. Currently, all user
..     accessible nodes (login and computational) have direct access to 15 TB of
..     usable storage available through the high performance, parallel filesystem.

..     The WFU DEAC cluster design allows for a great deal of scalability in the
..     key areas of storage and computational nodes. We use IBM's *General Parallel
..     File System* (GPFS) software to manage and present the disk storage
..     connected to the cluster. GPFS provides every key function that a cluster
..     requires for its data access: fault tolerance, redundancy, transparent
..     maintenance, scalability in performance (multiple GB/s), and scalability in
..     capacity (2 PB tested limit). With current SAN switch hardware, we can grow
..     our storage pool to include an additional 24~storage controllers, each of
..     which could provided 40-50 TB of storage~(1.0-1.2 PB). Our computational
..     nodes also enjoy significant growth potential. GPFS has a current limit of
..     2440 nodes. Existing switch hardware will allow for an additional 680
..     computational nodes. The purchase of expansion modules currently available
..     for these switches would allow an additional 480 computational nodes. Growth
..     beyond these additional 1160 nodes simply requires the purchase of another
..     networking switch.

..     As a whole, these technologies allow WFU DEAC cluster researchers to explore
..     a great many computation problems that exist in research today. The Myrinet
..     and Infiniband technologies provide the low latency, high bandwidth
..     communication that is essential for difficult parallel processing problems
..     (fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, black hole dynamics). The high performance
..     and large scale filesystem provides the backbone upon which users can tackle
..     the large data set problems (Monte Carlo simulations, genetics,
..     bioinformatics, nuclear/particle physics). Of course, the cluster is also
..     well suited to \`\`traditional'', single processor problems that have no
..     preconceived parallelization. With multi-core processors and compiler
..     technology, even traditional software can see some performance gains using
..     the WFU DEAC cluster and the compilers we license through compiler vector
..     optimizations.

.. Impact on WFU Research Goals
.. ````````````````````````````

..     The most important impact of the WFU DEAC facility is the promotion and
..     support of cross-department and cross-campus research collaborations. Over
..     its 5 year existence, the facility has helped to catalyze tremendous
..     cross-fertilization between research groups. This initiative has produced a
..     number of collaborations with experimentalists in the Medical School, the
..     Cancer Biology Center, and the Structural Biology Center that would be
..     impossible without the cluster. Through interactions and projects that were
..     initiated partly as a result of the cluster's availability, a Structural and
..     Computational Biophysics Graduate Track has been developed. A computational
..     chemistry-physics group has evolved and meets monthly to share research
..     results. Research collaborations with other institutions, such as UNC-Chapel
..     Hill and USAMRIID, have developed since the creation of the DEAC cluster.
..     One researcher collaborates with a faculty member from Winston-Salem State
..     University, a historically black university, who writes the parallel
..     programs for use on the DEAC cluster. Finally, collaborations with industry,
..     including Targacept, ReceptorSolutions, and Nanosonic have developed.
..     Targacept and ReceptorSolutions have ongoing and pending STTR proposals to
..     the NIH and the NSF with researchers (including J. Fetrow, PI, and P.
..     Santago, Investigator) in the departments of Biomedical Engineering,
..     Physics, and Computer Science.

..     The Wake Forest University DEAC cluster allows the pursuit of these types of
..     research projects within the liberal arts curriculum. In this environment,
..     both graduate and undergraduate students are actively engaged, working in
..     small groups, directly mentored by faculty. A unique example of the
..     interdisciplinary use of the DEAC cluster at this liberal arts university is
..     that of Tim Miller (co-investigator), Jennifer Burg, and Yue-ling Wang, both
..     in the Computer Science Department. Together with a local modern dance
..     company, these researchers use the cluster for an annual multimedia dance
..     performance. They published a paper entitled "Cluster Computation in Step
..     with Real-Time Dance: An Experiment in Art/Science Collaboration"in the 17th
..     International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing (2003) and
..     were invited to do a special presentation at the conference. Students
..     actively participate in these types of unique collaborations.

.. Impact on the WFU Educational Mission
.. `````````````````````````````````````

..     The University's support of a strong IT infrastructure and excellence in
..     teaching has actively encouraged faculty to innovate with computers in their
..     teaching. The installation of the DEAC cluster has added significantly to
..     the resources at our disposal and allows both undergraduate and graduate
..     students access to state-of-the-art computing facilities.

..     From the beginning, the cluster has been organized for use as a classroom
..     tool, with temporary student accounts, special queues for course use, and
..     disk space set aside for student- and course-generated data. Currently 6
..     courses (Bioinformatics, Physics of Biological Macromolecules, Parallel
..     Computing, Building Beowulf Clusters, Quantum Chemistry and Advanced Image
..     Analysis) have implemented use of the cluster so that students have hands-on
..     experience with parallel computing in these fields. The cluster has allowed
..     the development of several new courses, including Building Beowulf Clusters
..     and Computational Molecular Biophysics Laboratory. The course, Building
..     Beowulf Clusters, is unique and not offered in many places. Parallel
..     Computing, draws on the cluster in its curriculum with considerable success,
..     at least as judged by student comments. The course in quantum chemistry now
..     provides access to state-of-the-art computational chemistry tools, allowing
..     students to explore the structure of molecules in ways previously
..     unavailable.

..     Faculty members associated with this proposal are teaching graduate and
..     undergraduate courses that exploit the latest pedagogical theory and tools.
..     Drs. Fetrow and Salsbury developed and co-teach the Computational Biophysics
..     Laboratory and complementary lecture course, Physics of Biological
..     Macromolecules. In these interdisciplinary courses, students learn and apply
..     the basic principles of protein structure, thermodynamics, and
..     electrostatics. The lecture alternates between core material and discussions
..     of crucial papers, highlighting applications to research problems in protein
..     structure and function. The laboratory is project-based; students study
..     their assigned protein and write a research paper presenting and critically
..     reviewing their results, which is reviewed by other students in the class.
..     The laboratory part of this course would not exist without access to the
..     DEAC cluster. This year, the class studied the peroxiredoxin protein
..     structures, learning how to run various molecular mechanics and
..     electrostatic calculations (on the cluster) and interpreting those in terms
..     of protein structure. Undergraduate and graduate students from the
..     departments of Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics as well as
..     auditors from the local biopharmaceutical company, Targacept, attended.

..     Our teaching efforts impact both women and minorities. Two of the DEAC
..     cluster major users are women (Fetrow and Holzwarth) and both teach courses
..     that utilize the cluster. Both have been successful at mentoring women in
..     the sciences. One graduate student and one research associate in their
..     current laboratories are women. At another university, J. S. Fetrow had
..     three women win awards for undergraduate research under her direction. Drs.
..     Cook, Holzwarth, and Fetrow teach in the introductory physics courses at
..     Wake Forest and, in that context, make efforts to recruit students pursue
..     studies in the sciences, particularly computational physics and biophysics.
..     The Physics department has had great success attracting women into their
..     courses. Usually, over half of the students registered for these
..     introductory courses are women.
