Account Management Policy
=========================

This policy governs all aspects of user account management
(authorization, creation, and removal), within the WFU DEAC computing
environment.

Account Authorization
=====================

Faculty Account Requests
------------------------

Any faculty member of Wake Forest University's Reynolda campus may
request an account for use of the WFU DEAC computing environment. An
account will be granted to a faculty member pursuing active research or
developing innovative course curriculum requiring the use of resources
provided by the WFU DEAC computing environment. The department chair(s)
of the faculty member requesting the account will receive notification
of the account request and approval. The purpose of this notification is
to sustain and grow the facility by raising awareness of its usage among
the chairs and, indirectly, the Dean.

Faculty members from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine
campus may request an account for use of the WFU DEAC computing
environment. An account will be granted to a faculty member pursuing
active research or developing innovative course curriculum requiring the
use of resources provided and does not impose strict conditions upon the
operation and access to the WFU DEAC computing environment. As an
example, accounts created to conduct research that requires the entire
computing environment to become HIPPA compliant will not be authorized.

In developing innovative course content, faculty are strongly encouraged
to request the cluster resources required to build the course
curriculum. Educational uses of the cluster are strongly encouraged and
given high priority to ensure the facility and its infrastructure do not
impede the goals of the course.

Research Faculty Requests
-------------------------

Any research faculty member of Wake Forest University may request an
account for use of the WFU DEAC computing environment. If the research
faculty member is operating in the capacity of a post-doctoral research
staff member, the account authorization will derive from the `Staff
Account
Requests </Cluster:Account_Management_Policy#Staff_Account_Requests>`__
process described below. All other research faculty member account
requests will be evaluated on a case by case basis at the discretion of
the WFU DEAC facility systems management team and the WFU DEAC
Representative Committee.

Staff Account Requests
----------------------

Any staff member of Wake Forest University may request an account for
use of the WFU DEAC computing environment. An account will be granted to
a staff member under the following conditions: a) the staff member's
department head or supervisor endorses the request for access, b) the
staff member will be conducting research on behalf of a faculty member
(research associate of any kind) or providing direct support to a
faculty member (Information Technology Group), (c) the staff member is
developing curriculum or instructing a course that requires the use of
the WFU DEAC computing environment.

Student Account Requests
------------------------

Any student member of Wake Forest University may request an account for
use of the WFU DEAC computing environment. An account will be granted to
a student under the following conditions: a) the student's advisor
conducts research within the WFU DEAC computing environment, b) the
student's advisor endorses the request for an account.

An account will also be granted to students who are enrolled in a course
that has requested use of the WFU DEAC computing environment as part of
an integral role in the course curriculum. The request for a course
related student account must come from the instructors registered for
the course. The course related accounts shall only be valid for duration
of the course. Normal account termination procedures begin at the end of
the semester.

External Person Account Request
-------------------------------

An account will be granted to a person who is not directly affiliated
with Wake Forest University provided that: a) the person is directly
collaborating with a faculty member affiliated with Wake Forest
University, b) the WFU faculty member has an existing relationship with
the WFU DEAC computing environment, c) the WFU faculty member endorses
the request for an account. These accounts shall be valid only for the
duration of the collaboration with the WFU faculty member **or** until
the WFU faculty member no longer is affiliated with the WFU DEAC
computing environment.

For clarity, an **external person** shall be defined as someone who has
no official, direct relationship (academic or employment) with Wake
Forest University (either the Reynolda Campus or School of Medicine).

In certain cluster administration situations, a short term guest account
may be authorized by the system administration personnel to facilitate
normal operations of the facility.

Account Termination
===================

Default Account Authorizations
------------------------------

The default duration for which an account is authorized differs among
the account types delineated above. The following list specifies the
account types and their default period for which they are authorized:

+--------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Account Type             | Period of Authorization                |
+==========================+========================================+
| Faculty                  | Duration of faculty member's           |
|                          | association with the University,       |
|                          | either through employment or emeritus  |
|                          | appointment. To ensure faculty         |
|                          | accounts are current, renewal requests |
|                          | will be sent every two years to ensure |
|                          | the account is still required.         |
+--------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Staff                    | As authorized by supervisor up to 2    |
|                          | years, renewable every year            |
|                          | thereafter.                            |
+--------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Staff Class              | For the duration of the course plus    |
|                          | one academic semester. Limited         |
|                          | extensions can be granted on a case by |
|                          | case basis to allow, as examples, for  |
|                          | a student's completion of course       |
|                          | requirements or for additional work on |
|                          | the curriculum for publication.        |
+--------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Student Research         | As authorized by faculty advisor for   |
|                          | duration of student's enrollment at    |
|                          | the University. Upon request of an     |
|                          | advisor, limited extensions can be     |
|                          | granted on a case by case basis after  |
|                          | a student leaves the University to     |
|                          | allow, for example, a student's        |
|                          | completion of research collaboration.  |
+--------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Student Class            | For the duration of the course.        |
|                          | Limited extensions can be granted on a |
|                          | case by case basis to allow, as an     |
|                          | example, for the completion of course  |
|                          | requirements.                          |
+--------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| External Person          | As authorized by WFU sponsor up to 1   |
|                          | year, renewable every year thereafter. |
+--------------------------+----------------------------------------+
|                          |                                        |
+--------------------------+----------------------------------------+

| 
| Accounts are subject to immediate revocation of their authorization if
  use of the account has violated the terms of the `Cluster:Account
  Usage Policy </Cluster:Account_Usage_Policy>`__ or the "`Policy on
  Responsible and Ethical Use of Computing
  Resources <http://www.wfu.edu/organizations/CIT/ethical_use.html>`__"
  as approved by the `Wake Forest University Committee on Information
  Technology <http://groups.wfu.edu/CIT/>`__.

Revocation of Account
---------------------

Once the account is no longer authorized for use on the WFU DEAC
facility, a process shall be used to expire and remove the account. This
automated process will make a best effort to adhere to the following
protocol:

+--------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Date relative to end of  | Action Taken                           |
| authorization            |                                        |
+==========================+========================================+
| Prior To Authorization   | Account supported and open until       |
| Ending                   | authorized or requested extended date  |
|                          | arrives.                               |
+--------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Day Authorization Ends   | Account is no longer supported and     |
|                          | allowed expire.                        |
+--------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| After Authorization Ends | | Account remains expired until it is  |
|                          |   deleted.                             |
|                          | | Prior to deletion, email is sent to  |
|                          |   correlating advisor confirming       |
|                          |   removal and confirming data actions. |
|                          | | If data retention is desired, all    |
|                          |   file ownership and group membership  |
|                          |   is changed to correlating advisor.   |
+--------------------------+----------------------------------------+

| 
| The account termination protocol may be abridged or disregarded in
  cases where authorization must be terminated abruptly or the adherence
  to the protocol would cause significant risk to the normal operation
  of the WFU DEAC facilty.

Account Management
==================

Authorization Requests
----------------------

Requests for account authorization and group membership shall be
submitted through the WFU DEAC facility's designated request tracking
system in production at the time of the request. This should be done by
emailing [`mailto:deac-help@wfu.edu <mailto:deac-help@wfu.edu>`__\ \|
deac-help@wfu.edu] and following the
[http://www.deac.wfu.edu/accounts.html\ \| User Account Request] steps
on the WFU DEAC website.

Group Membership
----------------

Each operating system group that is available for assignment to user
accounts on the WFU DEAC facility has a designated approval authority
registered for the group. Each group membership requested for an account
shall be approved by that group's designated authority prior to its
addition. Because of the delays in communication associated with the
designated approval authorities, group membership requests can take
several business days to be approved and assigned to an account. In the
interests of time, authorization and creation of accounts can be
fulfilled **without** the requested group memberships assigned and, as
the group membership requests are approved, can be added at a later
date.

With little or no prior notice to the account holder, any group
membership on an account may be revoked by that group's designated
authority when requested through the designated request tracking system.

Sponsorship and Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, authorized accounts in the WFU DEAC facility are governed
and protected by the "`Policy on Responsible and Ethical Use of
Computing
Resources <http://www.wfu.edu/organizations/CIT/ethical_use.html>`__" as
approved by the `Wake Forest University Committee on Information
Technology <http://groups.wfu.edu/CIT/>`__.

However, conditions unique to the WFU DEAC facility exist and must be
emphasized. Specifically, accounts authorized by a sponsor of any kind
can be subject to the status, requests, and decisions of the sponsor.
The balance between the rights of the account holder and the rights of
the account sponsor are difficult to define fairly in a policy.
Determination of this balance shall be under the sole discretion, as an
arbiter between the two parties, of the WFU DEAC facility management and
will be guided by the `Cluster:Account Usage
Policy </Cluster:Account_Usage_Policy>`__ and "`Policy on Responsible
and Ethical Use of Computing
Resources <http://www.wfu.edu/organizations/CIT/ethical_use.html>`__".

With little or no prior notice to the account holder, a person that
authorizes or sponsors that account may revoke that authorization at any
time and cause the account to undergo the revocation process.

Transfer of Account Authorization
---------------------------------

Users and their accounts are subject to changes in authorization parties
(i.e. 'advisors') during the course of their academic career at Wake
Forest University. Users are required to notify the WFU DEAC facility
management through the `Authorization
Requests </Cluster:Account_Management_Policy#Authorization_Requests>`__
process of any changes that would affect an account's authorization
status or authority. While not an exhaustive or complete list, such
changes include: (a) change of department, (b) change of degree program,
(c) change of research group, or (d) change of research advisor.

Failure to provide this advance notification could result in the account
becoming subject to the account removal process.

Explicit Intent of Policy
=========================

Under no circumstances shall the edits or rough drafts or history of
this policy that results from the technology used to create and display
this policy be used to imply any meaning other than that clearly stated
in the written words of the latest version of the policy and approved by
the WFU DEAC facility Representative Committee and management.

Account Usage Policy
--------------------

University Policy
=================

The DEAC cluster facility is designed for use by University employees
and authorized students as well as a limited number of authorized
guests. All users, regardless of affiliation, are bound by the "Policy
on Responsible and Ethical Use of Computing Resources" as approved by
the Wake Forest University Committee on Information Technology. A copy
of this policy can be obtained at:

http://groups.wfu.edu/CIT/ethical_use_policy.html

Cluster Specific Policy
=======================

In addition to that general policy provided by the University, use of
the cluster incurs an additional set of guidelines designed to ensure
optimal operation of the facility.

General Usage
-------------

Given that this cluster is designed to aid the research of its users, a
certain level of professionalism and courtesy is assumed. Every attempt
will be made by the system software to maintain balance and fair usage
as defined by a representative committee designated by cluster users.
Users should abide by the restrictions imposed by the system software
and not attempt to circumvent its operation in any manner or for any
reason. In cases where the system software does not adequately balance
load or prevent system resource loads from reaching dangerous levels,
the user is responsible for limiting his or her activities
appropriately.

Representative Committee
------------------------

Each academic research group or department will provide a single
representative to participate in a committee whose charge is to
determine system resource allocation. This committee will also play a
key role in cluster planning and growth. Other issues that arise
regarding the cluster and its operation will also be presented to the
committee for discussion. There are no qualification restrictions (i.e.
faculty, staff, student) for members of this committee except that they
have full representative and decision-making status within their group.

User Accounts
-------------

User account authorization, creation, and deletion for the WFU DEAC
facility are governed by the `Account Management
Policy </Cluster:Account_Management_Policy>`__ as approved by the
Representative Committee. As specified by the WFU CIT policy, the
authorized user is responsible for all activity associated with the
account assigned to that user. Thus, good password selection, secure
access/authentication and limiting accounts to one per person are
absolute minimum requirements.

Each user account will be associated with a particular "group" within
the operating system. On UNIX based accounts, it is possible for users
to allow other members of their group to have access to their files and
directories. Users should note that, in giving fellow group members
access to their files and directories, they are assuming responsibility
for all consequences of that access.

Disk Usage
----------

Research storage disks are intended to host research data. User home
directory space is limited and should not be used for the creation or
retention of research data. Each contributing research group has access
to a standalone filesystem, that is not shared with other groups. Groups
that submit to the General Group Fair Share Target utilize shared
storage disks; if necessary, a quota system may be implemented to
restrict the amount of space groups consume in this shared space.

Research storage disks will be backed up weekly. All data retained on
research disks is backed up; therefore, as a best practice, users should
delete temporary, duplicate, or non-mission critical when it is no
longer needed to reduce backup times and size. Weekly backups are kept
for 8 weeks by default. Users with extremely high rate of change are
subject to fewer backups.

IMPORTANT: The cluster and its data disks should not be considered a
data warehouse, final storage repository, or personal backup drive.
Users found to be using research storage disks to retain non-research
data or inappropriate content could result in their account becoming
subject to the account removal process.

Login Procedures
----------------

Users connect interactively to the cluster facility solely through the
"head node(s)" of the cluster. All system activities should be performed
through the head nodes and the cluster queueing software. Interactive
login to the individual cluster nodes is prohibited unless expressly
allowed by the administrator.

Cluster Privileges
==================

Use of the cluster facility is a privilege that can and will be revoked
if deemed necessary by the cluster administrator. Chronic abuse or a
single severe, intentional malicious act are grounds for immediate
revocation of all DEAC cluster privileges. Users who are bound by the
Wake Forest University Honor Code are subject to further disciplinary
action under the provisions of the Code.

Versioning History
==================

-  This policy (version 3) was updated during the Spring 2016 to reflect
   changes to the cluster environment and renamed to provide clarity of
   purpose.
-  This policy (version 2) was updated during the Fall 2007 semester to
   reflect the adoption of the `Cluster:Account Management
   Policy </Cluster:Account_Management_Policy>`__.
-  This policy (version 1) was enacted by consensus during the Fall 2002
   semester.

-----------------
Fair Share Policy
-----------------

Basic Principles
================

The general goals of this fair share policy are:

#. Courses or other educational uses of the cluster will always have the
   highest priority. Course instructors may even request exclusive,
   dedicated use of a limited portion of the cluster for student use in
   class or laboratory sections.
#. Fair share calculations for a particular research group will be
   derived from monetary funds from grants or internal sources that are
   then provided to a particular individual and contributed to the WFU
   DEAC Facility.
#. Research groups or individual users, who have received an account in
   accordance to the `Account Management
   Policy </Cluster:Account_Management_Policy>`__ but have not yet
   contributed to the cluster, will gain low priority access at a level
   defined by the **General Group Fair Share Target**.
#. Contributions to the cluster will directly affect a research group's
   fair share calculation during the grace period.
#. Contributions to the cluster will have reduced affect on a research
   group's fair share calculation after the grace period.
#. The grace period and decay rate for a given contribution in a given
   year are fixed for those contributions and will not change during the
   life of that contribution. Retroactive changes to those values will
   not be allowed.

Brief Summary of Fair Share Calculation and Usage
=================================================

All **contributed funds** have an **apparent value**.

-  This apparent value will be 100% of the funds for the duration of the
   **Fund Grace Period**.
-  After the **Fund Grace Period**, the apparent value will be reduced
   each year by the **Fund Decay Rate**.

The **Individual Fair Share Target** for a principal investigator (or
group of PIs) is the percentage of the **Total Cluster Contributions**
that the PI's (or group of PIs) **Individual Contribution** occupies. A
portion of the **Individual Fair Share Target** of the default
(non-contributor) user group (also referred to as the **General Group
Fair Share Target**) is then added to each PI/co-PI **Individual Fair
Share Target**.

-  **Individual Contribution** is the sum of the **apparent value**\ s
   for all contributions made by the PI (or group of PIs).
-  **Individual Contribution** for the default (non-contributor) user
   group is the sum of the **apparent value**\ s for all contributions
   made to the cluster as a whole (i.e. University administration
   funding, grants for the cluster as a whole, etc.)
-  **Total Cluster Contributions** is the sum of all **Individual
   Contribution**\ s by both PI/co-PI and to the default user group.

When there are insufficient resources to begin job execution, enqueued
jobs will be prioritized based on a PI/co-PIs cluster usage history and
their **Individual Fair Share Target**. The priority scheme will work
toward ensuring that, under insufficient computational resource
conditions, PI/co-PIs will receive a percentage of cluster resources
specified by their **Individual Fair Share Target**. When jobs are
enqueued, prioritization for execution will be determined by the
scheduler, using **Individual Fair Share Target** and job resource
requirements to determine running order as computational resources
become available.

below in `Apparent Value
Calculation </Cluster:Fair_Share_Policy#Apparent_Value_Calculation>`__

Calculation </Cluster:Fair_Share_Policy#Fair_Share_Calculation>`__.

Footnotes :
   [1] Credit toward fair share will be applied at the end of the
   semester during which the course was held.
   [2] Credit toward fair share will be applied no sooner than the
   transfer of funds to the WFU DEAC cluster facility and no later than
   the end of the same semester. The exact date of credit within that
   window is at the discretion of the principal investigator(s).
   [3] Facilities Funding Coordinators refers to researchers who
   coordinate facility level grant funding with external funding
   agencies or secure institutional funding through efforts on behalf of
   the cluster facility.

Sharing of Fair Share Credits
=============================

   Fair share credits shall be split among the participating principal
   investigators (PPIs) as specified by unanimous consent of those PPIs.
   By default, unless instructed otherwise by those PPIs, the fair share
   credits shall be split equally among all PPIs. If there is a desire
   for non-default sharing but unanimous consent is not possible, the
   fair share allocation will be subject to the `terms of
   arbitration </Cluster:Fair_Share_Policy#Arbitration_Responsibility>`__
   of this policy.

General Group Fair Share Contributions
======================================

   Wake Forest University institutional funds from any non-Sponsored
   Program source provided for the cluster facility as a whole shall be
   attributed to the **General Group Fair Share Target** provided they
   fund the following expense categories:
   :# Software Licensing Fees for General Use software (compiler
   licenses, for example)

   :# Infrastructure Hardware Expenses (network switches, for example)

   :# Hardware Site Operational Expenses (co-location costs, for
   example)

Arbitration Responsibility
==========================

   The WFU DEAC Facility Representative Committee shall be the sole
   arbitrator for disputes in the apportionment of shared fair share
   allocations outlined in this policy.

   Under no circumstances shall the edits or rough drafts or history of
   this policy that results from the technology used to create and
